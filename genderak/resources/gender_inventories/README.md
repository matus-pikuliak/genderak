# BSRI

Stereotypes were extracted from _The measurment of psychological androgyny_
[[Sandra L. Bem 1974]](https://www.bibb.de/dokumente/pdf/AB26_WBT3_Vertiefung_Bem-1974.pdf).

```
because the BSRI was founded on a conception of the sex-typed person as someone
who has internalized society's sex-typed standards of desirable behavior for men
and women, these personality characteristics were selected as masculine or
feminine on the basis of sex-typed social desirability andnot on the basis of
differential endorsement by males and females as most other inventories have
done. That is, a characteristic qualified as masculine if it was judged to be
more desirable in American society for a man than for a woman, and it qualified
as feminine if it was judged to be more desirable for a woman than for a man.

The original words often use * to indicate any suffix, we have filled in these
words and removed some of them so that they are all adjectives.

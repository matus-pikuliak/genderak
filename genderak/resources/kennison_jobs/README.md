This dataset contains human ratings for various (compound) nouns produced by
human annotators. The original source of the data is _Comprehending Pronouns:
A Role for Word-Specific Gender Stereotype Information_ [Kennison & Trofe 2003](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1023599719948.pdf).

## Columns

### `noun`

The noun that is being rated. Most of these are _occupations_, but there are
some exceptions, e.g. _killer_, _father_.

### `score_by_females`, `score_by_males`

The stereotypical score assigned to the `noun` by _female_ or _male_ human
annotators. In general, I recommend simply averaging these two scores. The
instructions for annotators were as follows:

```
The following list contains everyday nouns. We would like you to consider how
likely you feel that the noun represents a person who is male or a person who is
female. A rating of “1” would indicate that a particular noun is very likely to
represent a person who is female. A rating of “7” would indicate that a
particular noun is very likely to represent a person who is male. A rating of
“4” would indicate that a particular noun is equally likely to represent a
person who is male or female. A rating of “2” or “3” and “5” and “6” would
indicate different degrees of likelihood that a particular noun represents a
person who is female or male. Circle only one rating for each item. Some nouns
may seem easier to rate than others. Be sure to circle the rating that reflects
your own opinion.
```

### `sd_by_females`, `sd_by_males`

The standard deviation for the `scores`.

### `is_occupation`

This binary column indicates whether the `noun` is an occupation, profession,
title or something similar. This was generated by prompting GPT-4 to answer the
following prompt:

```
Is '{noun}' a name for an occupation or a profession? Answer yer or no.
```

The `No.` results were subsequently manually evaluated.

### `frequency`

Log-frequency of the `noun` in the last 20 years according to Google Ngram.

```python
import math
import requests

import numpy as np

def frequency(noun):
    url = f'https://books.google.com/ngrams/json?content={noun}&year_start=2000&year_end=2020&corpus=26&smoothing=3'
    r = requests.get(url).json()[0]
    return math.log(np.mean(r['timeseries']) + 1e-12, 10)
```
